# SecEphemera

This project is a place for me to note down the various tools, guides, resources, etc., I come across related to Cybersecurity.

**Note:** I haven't tried everything on this list, so the mertis of some of these resources may be questionable. Eventually, I hope to come back to many of them, but in the mean time, everything here is USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
